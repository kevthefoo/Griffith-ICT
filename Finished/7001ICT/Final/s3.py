# Bits, bytes, words
# The word bit is derived from binary digit.
# A bit is one binary digit, that is a 0 or a 1.
# A byte is 8 bits.
# With a byte, you can represent the numbers 0 to 255. 255 = 2^8 − 1

# A word is a term used to describe a binary number of some number of bits, usually the maximum that a given computer can handle in one step.
# Negative numbers

# Fractional numbers in computers
# Single precision uses 32 bits. Double precision uses 64 bits
# The bits are grouped into 4 parts:
# Sign bit
# mantissa
# Exponent
# the sign of the exponent.
# ±mantissa × 10±exponent
