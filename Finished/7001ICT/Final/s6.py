# Variables

# type()
# Immutable objects

# The simple types in Python are immutable, but we will meet more complex
# types that are mutable.

# In Python, like JavaScript, the variables are just names for references.

# The types belong to the objects/values.

# Compiled languages are usually statically typed at compile time.

# Interpreted languages are often dynamically typed. The types of variables
# are bound at run time, and can change.

# Delete a variable
# x = 3
# del x
