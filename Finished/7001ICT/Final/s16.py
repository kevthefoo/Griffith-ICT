# Functions
# Keyworded arguments with default values

# By default, the value of b is 5
# def f(a, b=5):
#     return a + b

# Functions can normally see the values of global variables, but they can not normally assign new values to them.

# Make sure the global variable has been created before the function is called.

# How to improve the quality of your programs:
# Donâ€™t use any global variables inside your functions
# Use only parameters and return values to communicate between functions
# Have as few global variables in your program as possible
