# About Python 3

"""
Definition: A programming language is an artificial language
for describing actions to be performed by a computer, that is
readable by both human programmers and computers.

# High-level programming languages
# High-level programming languages are languages that are structured for more human readability than lower level
# languages, such as assembly language.

# The first high-level, third-generation programming language was Fortran


# An interpreter is an alternative to a compiler.

# An interpreter reads a program and executes it immediately.

# Compiler reads the program and writes it out again in a different language, without executing it.
# The translated program is run later.

# A program that is compiled will run faster than a program that is being interpreted.

# Python 3 is a hybrid programming language. It is both compiled and interpreted.

# REPL, Read Evaluate Print Loop
# REPL mode is best for quick play and testing of ideas.

# Python code is (usually) saved in text files with the extension.py.
