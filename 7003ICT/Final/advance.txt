# Limitations of relational DBs
Data model:
A predefined data model (i.e., the schema) may not be suitable for unstructured or heterogeneous data

Query language:
The support for flexible and complex queries may not be required for specific applications

Distributed data integrity:
Relational database systems don’t scale well over distributed servers because of data partitioning and join problems.

Complexity:
Many unnecessary features for specific purposes

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NoSQL
Aims to provide better performance (query speed) and flexibility (ability to change structure and increase size).
Also, better reliability

Characteristics of NoSQL systems
1. Flexible schema, easy to set up
2. Support distributed database architectures
3. Focus on massive scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance.
4. Do not have a high-level query language
5. It’s hence necessary to write applications in some lower-level programming language.

In general NoSQL databases can be:
key-value: SimpleDB, Redis, Memcached, Dynamo, Voldemort
document: MongoDB, CouchDB
column-oriented: BigTable, HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, PNUTS
graph: Neo4j, GraphDB
