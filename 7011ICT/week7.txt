What is graph?
A graph is made up of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections), and both can store data.

Key Terms:
- Endpoints: The two vertices connected by an edge (e.g., U and V for edge a).

- Incident Edges: Edges connected to a vertex (e.g., a, d, and b are incident on V).

- Adjacent Vertices: Vertices connected directly by an edge (e.g., U and V).

- Degree: Number of edges connected to a vertex (e.g., vertex X has degree 5).

- Parallel Edges: Multiple edges between the same pair of vertices (e.g., h and i between X and Z).

- Self-loop: An edge that connects a vertex to itself (e.g., j on vertex Z).

- Path:  A sequence that starts and ends with vertices, with edges in between (e.g., V–b->X–h->Z).

- Simple Path: A path where no vertex or edge is repeated.

Graph Properties:

- Subgraph: A graph formed from a subset of vertices and edges of another graph.

- Connected Graph: Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex via some path.

- Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

- Acyclic Graph: A graph with no cycles.

- Spannign tree: A spanning tree is a subgraph that connects all vertices of a graph without forming any cycles.
=================================================================================================================================
Any one of these 5 equivalent conditions defines a tree:
- Has exactly V - 1 edges and no cycles.

- Has exactly V - 1 edges and is connected.

- Is connected, but removing any edge disconnects it.

- Is acyclic, but adding any edge creates a cycle.

- There is exactly one simple path between every pair of vertices.
